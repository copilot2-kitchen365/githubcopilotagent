document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', addSampleData);
```

This will add 5 sample employees when the page loads.

```html
<option value="NewDepartment">New Department</option>
```

Modify the CSS custom properties in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #667eea;
    --secondary-color: #764ba2;
    /* Add more custom properties */
}
```

### Adding New Fields
1. Add input fields to both forms in `index.html`
2. Update the `Employee` class constructor in `script.js`
3. Modify the table headers and display logic
